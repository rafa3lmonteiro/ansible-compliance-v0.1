# Compliance in Linux servers with Ansible

# About the project:

The idea of this project is to reduce the toil (manual work) of Sysadmins to verify and remedy compliance requirements on Linux servers.

- This is a group of playbooks to verify and fix compliance requeriments for Linux servers using Ansible language.

In the current version I am writing playbooks to check security compliance requirements and system settings on Linux Red Hat Enterprise "RHEL" and CentOS Linux systems.
